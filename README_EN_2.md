Lesson 2:

General Intro:
InternLM is a large langauge model framework. In this lesson we will be using InternLM-7B, which is a Pretrained AI model trained on a large amount of data on a large amount of GPUs. We also cover the demo along with the agent framework Lagent.
XComposer:
Uses images as well in order to understand pictures and extract great meaning from it.
Setup:
In order to get this software to work efficiently you will need to use python with pip. You will need to also install Hugginface and use it to download InternLM. You can also use Modelscope for this.
Homework Lesson:
Using InternLM Studio to create a small story in Chinese. First you will need to enable a GPU using the free cloud credits, and you can enter it with Jupyter Notebook. Then you will enter bash and enter the commands located on the InternLM GitHub. It will install the dependencies. You can now install some other programs to make sure you can use InternLM. You will then clone the GitHub repository. Make sure to remember to change your path. 
Other Dev Methods:
Visual Studio Code will also work in this web environment, but will behave in a different way. The commands used are still the same. You can also use the chatbot in the terminal and interact with it.
Web Demo:
It will run using a command, it’s optimal to open it in your own desktop environment. You will have to set up an SSH key in order to enter the environment to use the machine remotely. Doing this is relatively simply, and takes a few clicks inside of InternLM Studio. When entering the command for the web demo it will load the model and then the userinterface so that you can chat with the AI Model. In the homework and in this example you are to generate a 300 word story as an example.
In the web demo you can also use models from an API such as OpenAI, and it’s easy to switch. Switch inside of the user interface. Computing needs will be different from different mode sizes. The exact requirements and procedures are on GitHub. After setup you will enter the IP designated by the cloud environment and use words along with images to example meaning. It can also search through image databases to add images to documents of text. You can also ask it about images and their characteristics.
