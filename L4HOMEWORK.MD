Lesson 4 Homework

The mother of all tasks, waiting about 2 hours to get an AI model trained and suffering from bad compatiblity.
I orginally used the PIP package of xtuner but switched enviorments to install it from source.
After I installed it from source I used my cluttered disorganized files to train InternLM2-Chat-1.8B.
Okay, I finally got it work after much trial and error with the config file.
I'm very proud of myself I even finished this project to be honest.
I have now finished the entire model, currently converting to HF format.
It took about 3 Hours from start to finish.
I recall there is a lot more work to do, but I will wait for the instructor to tell the class.
