Summary of all I've learning during the InternLM Course:
During this course there was a series of both videos to watch and homework assignments.
Video one was pretty easy, being a passive lesson.
Video one was a general overview of most of the OpenMM ecosystem.
Video two was about the basics of using InternLM.
Video two was the first video with a task assigned, that task specifcly being to generate a small story. 
The only unfortunte thing is I realized due to my location I would not be able to use the web demo.
For the rest of the program I omitted it.
The Third video centered around LangChain.
It seemed that the embedding model that was presented wasn't avilable on Chinese servers, and that the Huggingface Mirror was not working at the time.
Since I could access Huggingface I uploaded the files to OpenXLab, I hope they are used by other students who may have trouble with that.
I did Video 4 last.
I had to try video 4 two times, once for 4 hours and then again for about 2 hours with the added troubleshooting of the configuration files.
Video 5 was about deployment, I tested a relay between one terminal window and another.
It seemed to work well, altough it seemed slow either due to low computational power or just having too many instances.
Video 6 was understandable, however I couldn't get OpenCompass to get predictions out of InternLM2 1.8B.
The program itself worked, I'll need to investigate.

Lesson 3 and 4 definetly opened up my problem solving skills the most.
I plan to do a lot more with the InternStudio platform.
I should really clean up my files though first.
