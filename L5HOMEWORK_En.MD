Lesson 5 Homework

LMDeploy was fun to use. As per all the lessons I opted to use InternLM2 1.8B.
I really regret not using InterLM2 1.8B with the XTuner tutorial, but it is what it is.
Regardless, I started by converting the weights to a format thats good for Turbomind/Triton.

Then afterwards, I verifyed it worked as an API program, and used another terminal window to check that it worked on the other side too.

My jupyter notebook enviroment has gotten quite messy, but I'm not going to fully clean it out until I'm completely done with the course.

Other than that, I've had a good time so far and I'm excited to do Lesson 6.
